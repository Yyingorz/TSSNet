The integration of renewable energy resources (RESs) into energy systems presents significant operational 
challenges due to their intermittent and stochastic nature. Microgrids (MGs) offer a compelling alternative 
for reliable accommodation of various RESs. However, multiple uncertainties, caused by the introduction of 
multi-RESs and load fluctuations, complicates the operation of MGs. To address this issue, we introduce TSSNet, 
an innovative neural network-based two-stage stochastic programming framework for grid-connected MG operation. 
Firstly, we developed an autoencoder to generate a compact representation across the scenario sets, enabling 
TSSNet to handle any number of scenarios. Then, a novel sampling approach is proposed to assist TSSNet in 
accurately capturing the policy between the two stages. Consequently, TSSNet can efficiently address multiple 
uncertainties, alleviating the dependency between problem scale and scenarios, and achieving near-optimal 
solutions rapidly. Simulations in three different cases validate TSSNet's flexibility and effectiveness in
various practical settings.
